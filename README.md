# Kanji Stroke Order

Kanji Stroke Order is a simple command line application to automate generation of stroke order import files for Anki flashcards with the purpose of learning to write kanji.
It takes as input a tsv containing vocabulary entries and optionally any text file containing kanji. It will create a card for every unique kanji found in the kanji file, or, if one is not provided, the word column of the vocabulary file.
It uses [kanjidic2](http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjd2index.html) as the information source. The card format is as can be seen below.
Front:
![example_1](https://my.mixtape.moe/hdoptf.png)
Back:
![example_2](https://my.mixtape.moe/pdqocc.png) ![example_3](https://my.mixtape.moe/kejwox.png)

The import file consists of the following fields in this order:
  - Kanji
  - Main Example
  - Main Example Hidden
  - Main Example Reading
  - Unicode (used to get the svg files)
  - Meaning
  - 音読み
  - 訓読み
  - なのり
  - Misc Info
  - 単語

### Prerequisites

* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
* The svg files from the [kanji-colorize](https://github.com/cayennes/kanji-colorize) project. They can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cayennes/kanji-colorize/releases).
* (Optional) Anki [deck](stroke-order-starter.apkg) with a single card for the kanji 人. Downloading this is purely optional but you'll need to create a your own note type and layout otherwise. This deck includes the note type formatted in accordance to the inputs generated by the application and its layout is as seen in the examples above.

### Usage

1. Make sure you have everything you need from the prerequisites section.

2. Extract the colorize-kanji-spectrum folder into your collection.media folder. This folder should be localized at C:\Users\[your name]\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\[anki profile name]\collection.media\

3. Download the jar file and run it:
```
java -jar stroke-order-builder.jar -v <filepath> [<word-column> <reading-column>] [-k <filepath> [<column>]] -o <filepath>

```
If columns aren't specified, the first columns will be used by default.

4. Or alternatively compile it yourself from the source:
```
javac -cp  ..\lib\*;. main.java
java -cp ..\lib\*;. main -v <filepath> [<word-column> <reading-column>] [-k <filepath> [<column>]] -o <filepath>
```
